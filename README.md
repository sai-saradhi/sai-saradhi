## About me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Sai Saradhi, a computer science diploma student passionate about coding and software development. I enjoy exploring new technologies, writing clean code, and building practical projects. Currently, I'm learning Python and diving into the world of software engineering with interests in web development and data structures.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I love reading about new tech trends, problem-solving challenges, and figuring out how things work under the hood. Always looking forward to contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with fellow developers.

I believe in continuous learning and enjoy sharing knowledge along the way. Letâ€™s connect and grow together! ðŸš€
